      "Making placements\n",
      "[\n",
      "]\n",
      "Aid climbing relies on the climber making placements onto the rock into which they attach aiders and ascend. Traditional aid climbing involved hammering in fixed placements (e.g. pitons, bolts, copperheads), a practice that made traditional aid climbing routes easier over time as later teams could use the placements of earlier teams. On advanced aid routes (i.e. A-grade above A3+), the act of hammering in fixed placements can be enough to shake the climber off the existing tenuous placements, so care and skill are required. Clean aid climbing avoids using any hammers, and thus the placements are effectively those of a traditional climber (although hooks are also used). Aid climbers generally try to make placements as high above their current position as possible to move efficiently.\n",
      "Using aiders\n",
      "[\n",
      "]\n",
      "Once a new placement is made, the aid climber will clip their daisy chain and an aider into the latest placement above their head and then bounce-test it; on passing that test, they then fully step into the aider attached to this new placement while clipping in the rope into the lower placement. Once completed, they release the lower daisy chain and its aider from the lower placement and climb up the new aider. These steps must be done in sequence to avoid a position where the climber comes free of any placement, or becomes temporarily dependent on a weak position.\n",
      "Bounce testing\n",
      "[\n",
      "]\n",
      "Free climbers will only know if their protection placements can carry the weight of a fall if it happens; some will pull on their placements as a simple test, but placing their body weight on the placement would be a form of aid. In contrast, aid climbers continuously \"bounce test\" their placements by loading their body weight onto them while using the lower placement as a backup in case the new placement fails. Excessive bounce-testing can make the extraction of the placements by the second climber difficult (i.e. the placements become really wedged into the cracks) and can result in longer timelines, damaged rock (where hammers are used to extract the placement), or having to leave placements on the route.\n",
      "Jumaring on fixed ropes\n",

      " Aid grades can change materially over time due to improvements in aid equipment and the impact of repeated ascents that subsequent aid climbing teams make to a route.\n",
      " Climbing author Chris McNamara outlines in his 2011 book \n",
      "Yosemite Big Walls\n",
      ", how the grade of a typical \"new A5 route\" in Yosemite evolves over time:\n",
      "A5. First 5 teams to ascend: The new route has very little installed or fixed in-situ equipment (e.g. copperheads, pitons, bolts), and the rock is weak and fragile in places.\n",
      "A4. Teams 6 to 20 ascend: Half the copperheads are now fixed, pin placements are solid (from repeated hammering), bolts have replaced pulled or broken rock features; some 'chicken bolts' (\n",
      "i.e\n",
      " excess bolting) are added at cruxes, and fully bolted belay anchors in places.\n",
      "A3/A4. Teams 21 to 40 ascend: Almost all the copperheads are fixed; all of the weak and loose rock is gone; more belay bolts and \"chicken bolts\" have been installed.\n",
      "A3+. Teams +41 ascend: The route now \"reaches equilibrium\"; all copperheads are in place and the cruxes fixed; piton placements so beat out that they now easily take hammerless gear.\n",
      "While different aid grading systems have been devised to address this (e.g. the \"new wave\"), in \n",
      "Yosemite Big Walls\n",
      ", McNamara argues: \"Although it was originally touted as being more precise, than the previous A1-A5 system, it is now clear the new wave system only brought more confusion to the rating process\".\n",
      " In practice, aid-climbing authors use a \"composite\" of the two systems (original and \"new wave\"), going from A0 to A6, and focused on the number of \"bodyweight placements\" (i.e. \"tenuous\" aid placements that can only hold a static bodyweight) as opposed to \"bombproof placements\" (belay-like aid placements that can hold a falling body) on a pitch, as a guide to the consequences of any leader fall.\n",
